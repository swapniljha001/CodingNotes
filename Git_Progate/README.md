# Git Study
This is not an exhaustive list of Git commands, this is an intro to the **Git Flow**. This is basic stuff. There are lots of lists of commands on the internet.

Open this in Google Collab to view the `pictures`.

### Summary
These are the most commonly used commands.
```
git clone repo_URL

cd repo_folder

* Make changes here *

git config user.email username@example.com

git config user.name "Your Name"

git add .

git commit -m "Commit Message"

git push origin master

```

You need to generate a personal token on GitHub Developer settings in order to push files to the original repo.
