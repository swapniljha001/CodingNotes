# UNIX Command Line Basics

This is an introuction to Linux Terminal Commands, and how to access the files via the **Terminal**.

Open this in Google Collab to view the `pictures`, `gifs`, or even run the `commands`.

I'd suggest to run the commands directly in your Linux system for faster executions.

### Summary
These are the most commonly used commands.
```
git clone repo_URL

* Make changes here *

git config user.email username@example.com

git config user.name "Your Name"

git add .

git commit -m "Commit Message"

git push origin master
```
